To build Reaper without rebuilding the UI, run the following command : 

```mvn clean package```

To only regenerate the UI (requires npm and bower) : 

```mvn generate-sources -Pbuild-ui```

To rebuild both the UI and Reaper : 

```mvn clean package -Pbuild-ui```


# Building Docker Image


```mvn clean package docker:build```


# Building Using Docker

To simplify the build toolchain it's possible to build everything using Docker itself.  See the [Docker]({{<ref "docs/install/docker.md">}}) section for details.
