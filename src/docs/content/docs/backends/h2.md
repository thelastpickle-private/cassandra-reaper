# H2 Backend

To use H2 as the persistent storage for Reaper, the storageType setting must be set to database in the Reaper configuration YAML file. When using H2 storage, the database will be automatically created under the path configured in the configuration YAML file. An example of how to configure H2 as persistent storage for Reaper can be found in the cassandra-reaper-h2.yaml.


```yaml
storageType: database
database:
  # H2 JDBC settings
  driverClass: org.h2.Driver
  url: jdbc:h2:~/reaper-db/db;MODE=PostgreSQL
  user:
  password:
  
```
