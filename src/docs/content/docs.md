See the [download](/download/) section for information on how to download and install reaper.

## Community

We have a [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tlp-apache-cassandra-reaper-users) and [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/thelastpickle/cassandra-reaper) available.

## Configuration

An example testing configuration YAML file can be found from within this project repository:
`src/test/resources/cassandra-reaper.yaml`

The configuration file structure is provided by Dropwizard, and help on configuring the server,
database connection, or logging, can be found at:

http://www.dropwizard.io/1.1.0/docs/manual/configuration.html

### Backends

Cassandra Reaper can be used with either an ephemeral memory storage or persistent database. 

For persistent relational database storage, you must either setup PostgreSQL or H2. You also need to set `storageType: database` in the config file.

Sample yaml files are available in the `resource` directory for each storage backend:  
* cassandra-reaper-memory.yaml
* cassandra-reaper-postgres.yaml
* cassandra-reaper-h2.yaml
* cassandra-reaper-cassandra.yaml

For configuring other aspects of the service, see the available configuration options in later section
of this page.

#### Memory Backend

Running Reaper with memory storage, which is not persistent, means that all
the registered clusters, column families, and repair runs will be lost upon service restart.
The memory based storage is meant to be used for testing purposes only. Enable this type of storage by using the `storageType: memory` setting in your config file (enabled by default).

```yaml
storageType: memory
```


#### H2 Backend

When using H2 storage the database will automatically created for you under the path configured in `cassandra-reaper.yaml`. Please
comment/uncomment the H2 settings and modify the path as needed or use the `cassandra-reaper-h2.yaml` as a base.

```yaml
storageType: database
database:
  # H2 JDBC settings
  driverClass: org.h2.Driver
  url: jdbc:h2:~/reaper-db/db;MODE=PostgreSQL
  user:
  password:
  
```

#### Postgres Backend

The schema will be initialized/upgraded automatically upon startup in the configured database.
Make sure to specify the correct credentials in your JDBC settings in `cassandra-reaper.yaml` to allow objects creation.


```yaml
storageType: database
database:
  # PostgreSQL JDBC settings
  driverClass: org.postgresql.Driver
  user: postgres
  password: 
  url: jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1/reaper
```

#### Cassandra Backend

For persistent Apache Cassandra storage, you need to set `storageType: cassandra` in the config file.
You'll also need to fill in the connection details to your Apache Cassandra cluster used to store the Reaper schema (reaper_db by default), in the `cassandra: ` section of the yaml file. 

```yaml
storageType: cassandra
cassandra:
  clusterName: "test"
  contactPoints: ["127.0.0.1"]
  keyspace: reaper_db
  queryOptions:
    consistencyLevel: LOCAL_QUORUM
    serialConsistencyLevel: SERIAL
```

When using SSL:

```yaml
cassandra:
  storageType: cassandra
  clusterName: "test"
  contactPoints: ["127.0.0.1"]
  keyspace: reaper_db
  authProvider:
    type: plainText
    username: cassandra
    password: cassandra
  ssl:
    type: jdk
```

The Apache Cassandra backend is the only one that allows running several Reaper instances at once. This provides high availability and allows to repair multi DC clusters (see the **Multi-DC** section below).

You will need to create a keyspace to store your data.  This is installation specific, you will need to fill in your own datacenter names.  For example:

```none
CREATE KEYSPACE reaper_db WITH replication = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'datacenter1': 3};
```
    

### Other Configuration settings


The Reaper service specific configuration values are:

`segmentCount`:

Defines the default amount of repair segments to create for newly registered Cassandra
repair runs (token rings). When running a repair run by the Reaper, each segment is
repaired separately by the Reaper process, until all the segments in a token ring
are repaired. The count might be slightly off the defined value, as clusters residing
in multiple data centers require additional small token ranges in addition to the expected.
You can overwrite this value per repair run, when calling the Reaper.

`repairParallelism`:

Defines the default type of parallelism to use for repairs.
Repair parallelism value must be one of: "sequential", "parallel", or "datacenter_aware".
If you try to use "datacenter_aware" in clusters that don't support it yet (older than 2.0.12),
Reaper will fall back into using "sequential" for those clusters.

`repairIntensity`:

Repair intensity is a value between 0.0 and 1.0, but not zero. Repair intensity defines the amount of time to sleep between triggering each repair segment while running a repair run. When intensity is one, it means that Reaper doesn't sleep at all before triggering next segment, and otherwise the sleep time is defined by how much time it took to repair the last segment divided by the intensity value. 0.5 means half of the time is spent sleeping, and half running. Intensity 0.75 means that 25% of the total time is used sleeping and 75% running. This value can also be overwritten per repair run when invoking repairs.

`incrementalRepair`:

Incremental repair is a boolean value (true | false). Note that this is only supported with the PARALLEL repairParallelism setting. For more details in incremental repair, please refer to the following article.http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/more-efficient-repairs

*Note*: We do not currently recommend using incremental repair before Cassandra 4.0 as subtle bugs can lead to overstreaming and cluster instabililty.

`repairRunThreadCount`:

The amount of threads to use for handling the Reaper tasks. Have this big enough not to cause
blocking in cause some thread is waiting for I/O, like calling a Cassandra cluster through JMX.

`hangingRepairTimeoutMins`:

The amount of time in minutes to wait for a single repair to finish. If this timeout is reached,
the repair segment in question will be cancelled, if possible, and then scheduled for later
repair again within the same repair run process.

`scheduleDaysBetween`:

Defines the amount of days to wait between scheduling new repairs.
The value configured here is the default for new repair schedules, but you can also
define it separately for each new schedule. Using value 0 for continuous repairs
is also supported.

`storageType`:

Whether to use database or memory based storage for storing the system state.
Value can be either "memory", "database" or "cassandra".
If you are using the recommended (persistent) storage type "database" or "cassandra", you need to define
the database client parameters in a database/cassandra section in the configuration file. See the example
settings in provided testing configuration in *src/test/resources/cassandra-reaper.yaml*.

`jmxPorts`:

Optional mapping of custom JMX ports to use for individual hosts. The used default JMX port
value is 7199. [CCM](https://github.com/pcmanus/ccm) users will find IP and port number
to add in `~/.ccm/<cluster>/*/node.conf` or by running `ccm <node> show`.

`jmxAuth`:

Optional setting for giving username and password credentials for the used JMX connections
in case you are using password based JMX authentication with your Cassandra clusters.

```
jmxAuth:
  username: cassandra
  password: cassandra
```

`enableCrossOrigin`:

Optional setting which you can set to be "true", if you wish to enable the CORS headers
for running an external GUI application, like [this project](https://github.com/spodkowinski/cassandra-reaper-ui).

`autoScheduling`:

Optional setting to automatically setup repair schedules for all non-system keyspaces in a cluster.
If enabled, adding a new cluster will automatically setup a schedule repair 
for each keyspace. Cluster keyspaces are monitored based on a configurable frequency,
so that adding or removing a keyspace will result in adding / removing the corresponding scheduled repairs.

`repairManagerSchedulingIntervalSeconds`:  

Controls the pace at which the Repair Manager will schedule processing of the next segment. Reducing this value from 30s (default) to a lower value can speed up fast repairs by orders of magnitude.
 
`jmxConnectionTimeoutInSeconds`:  

Controls the timeout for establishing JMX connections. The value should be low enough to avoid stalling simple operations in multi region clusters, but high enough to allow connections under normal conditions.  
The default is set to 5 seconds.
  
Notice that in the *server* section of the configuration, if you want to bind the service
to all interfaces, use value "0.0.0.0", or just leave the *bindHost* line away completely.
Using "*" as bind value won't work.  


## Multi-DC 

For security reasons, it is possible that Reaper will be able to access only a single DC nodes through JMX (multi region clusters for example).
In the case where the JMX port is accessible (with or without authentication) from the running Reaper instance only to the nodes in the current DC, it is possible to have a multiple instances of Reaper running in different DCs.

This setup works **with Apache Cassandra as a backend only**. It is unsuitable for memory, H2 and Postgres.

Reaper instances will rely on lightweight transactions to get leadership on segments before processing them.
Reaper checks the number of pending compactions and actively running repairs on all replicas before processing a segment. The `datacenterAvailability` setting in the yaml file controls the behavior for metrics collection :  

* `datacenterAvailability: ALL` requires direct JMX access to all nodes across all datacenters.
* `datacenterAvailability: LOCAL` requires jmx access to all nodes in the datacenter local to reaper. If Reaper instances exist in remote datacenters, metrics can be collected asynchronously through the Cassandra storage (not mandatory).
* `datacenterAvailability: EACH` means each datacenter requires at minimum one reaper instance which has jmx access to all nodes within that datacenter. Metrics from nodes in remote datacenters must be collected through the Cassandra storage backend. If all metrics aren't available, the segment will be postponed for later processing.

## Docker

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) will need to be installed in order to use the commands in this section.

### Building Reaper Packages with Docker

Building Reaper packages requires quite a few dependencies, especially when making changes to the web interface code. In an effort to simplify the build process, Dockerfiles have been created that implement the build actions required to package Reaper.

To build the JAR and other packages which are then placed in the _packages_ directory run the following commands from the top level directory:

```bash
cd src/packaging
docker-compose build reaper-build-packages && docker-compose run reaper-build-packages
```

### Building Reaper Docker Image

To build the Reaper Docker Image which is then added to the local image cache using the `cassandra-reaper:latest` tag, run the following commands from the top level directory:

```bash
cd src/server
mvn package docker:build
```

Note that the above command will build the Reaper JAR and place it in the _src/server/target_ directory prior to creating the Docker Image. It is also possible to build the JAR file using the [Docker package build](building-reaper-packages-with-docker) instructions and omitting the `package` command from the above Maven commands.

### Start Docker Environment

From the top level directory change to the _src/packaging_ directory

```bash
cd src/packaging
```

Start the Cassandra cluster:

```bash
docker-compose up cassandra
```

The `nodetool` Docker Compose service can be used to check on the Cassandra node's status:

```bash
docker-compose run nodetool status
```

Once the Cassandra node is online and accepting CQL connections, create the required `reaper_db` Cassandra keyspace to allow Reaper to save its cluster and scheduling data.

By default, the `reaper_db` keyspace is created using a replication factor of 1. To change this replication factor, provide the intended replication factor as an optional argument:

```bash
docker-compose run initialize-reaper_db [$REPLICATION_FACTOR]
```

Wait a few moments for the `reaper_db` schema change to propagate, then start Reaper:

```bash
docker-compose up reaper
```


### Access The Environment

Once started, the UI can be accessed through:

http://127.0.0.1:8080/webui/

When adding the Cassandra node to the Reaper UI, use the IP address found via:

```bash
docker-compose run nodetool status
```

The helper `cqlsh` Docker Compose service has also been included:

```bash
docker-compose run cqlsh
```

### Destroying the Docker Environment

When terminating the infrastructure, use the following command to stop
all related Docker Compose services:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To completely clean up all persistent data, delete the `./data/` directory:

```bash
rm -rf ./data/
```
