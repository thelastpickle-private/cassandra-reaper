Reaper for Apache Cassandra
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thelastpickle/cassandra-reaper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thelastpickle/cassandra-reaper)

*Note: This repo is a fork from the original Reaper project, created by the awesome folks at Spotify.  The WebUI has been merged in with support for incremental repairs added.* 

Reaper is a centralized, stateful, and highly configurable tool for running Apache Cassandra
repairs against single or multi-site clusters.

The current version supports running Apache Cassandra cluster repairs in a segmented manner, 
opportunistically running multiple parallel repairs at the same time on different nodes
within the cluster. Basic repair scheduling functionality is also supported.

Reaper comes with a GUI, which if you're running in local mode can be at http://localhost:8080/webui/ 

Please see the [Issues](https://github.com/thelastpickle/cassandra-reaper/issues) section for more
information on planned development, and known issues.


System Overview
---------------

Reaper consists of a database containing the full state of the system, a REST-full API,
and a CLI tool called *spreaper* that provides an alternative way to issue commands to a running
Reaper instance. Communication with Cassandra nodes in registered clusters is handled through JMX.

Reaper system does not use internal caches for state changes regarding running repairs and
registered clusters, which means that any changes done to the storage will reflect to the running
system dynamically.

You can also run the Reaper with memory storage, which is not persistent, and is meant to
be used only for testing purposes.

This project is built on top of Dropwizard:
http://dropwizard.io/


Usage
-----

To run Cassandra Reaper you need to simply build a project package using Maven, and
then execute the created Java jar file, and give a path to the system configuration file
as the first and only argument. You can also use the provided `bin/cassandra-reaper` script
to run the service.

When using database based storage, you must setup a PostgreSQL database yourself and configure
Reaper to use it, or use an embedded H2 database (set the appropriate configuration in the yaml file). 
The schema will get initialized/upgraded upon startup by FlyWay.

When using cassandra based storage, you must setup an Apache Cassandra database yourself and configure
Reaper to use it. You need to create a keyspace and configure reaper to use it in the yaml file. The schema will be created by Reaper on the first run.  

Reaper uses the dropwizard-cassandra bundle and full configuration reference is available here : https://github.com/composable-systems/dropwizard-cassandra

Find more information on how to use each storage backend in the **Configuration** section below.

For configuring the service, see the available configuration options in later section
of this readme document.

You can call the service directly through the REST API using a tool like *curl*. You can also
use the provided CLI tool in *bin/spreaper* to call the service.

Run the tool with *-h* or *--help* option to see usage instructions.

### Debian and RPM Packages

#### Make

Debian and RPM packages can be built from this project using Make, for example:

```bash
make all
```

#### Docker

A [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) build environment is
also provided to build the entire project and can be run by using
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/):

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-build/docker-compose.yml build \
    && docker-compose -f docker-build/docker-compose.yml run build
```

The final packages will be located within:

```./packages/```


Configuration
-------------

An example testing configuration YAML file can be found from within this project repository:
`src/test/resources/cassandra-reaper.yaml`

The configuration file structure is provided by Dropwizard, and help on configuring the server,
database connection, or logging, can be found at:

http://www.dropwizard.io/1.1.0/docs/manual/configuration.html

**Storage Backend**

Cassandra Reaper can be used with either an ephemeral memory storage or persistent database. Running Reaper with memory storage, which is not persistent, means that all
the registered clusters, column families, and repair runs will be lost upon service restart.
The memory based storage is meant to be used for testing purposes only. Enable this type of storage by using the `storageType: memory` setting in your config file (enabled by default).

For persistent relational database storage, you must either setup PostgreSQL or H2. You also need to set `storageType: database` in the config file.
* PostgreSQL - The schema will be initialized/upgraded automatically upon startup in the configured database.
Make sure to specify the correct credentials in your JDBC settings in `cassandra-reaper.yaml` to allow objects creation.
* H2 - the database will automatically created for you under the path configured in `cassandra-reaper.yaml`. Please
comment/uncomment the H2 settings and modify the path as needed or use the `cassandra-reaper-h2.yaml` as a base.

For persistent Apache Cassandra storage, you need to set `storageType: cassandra` in the config file.
You'll also need to fill in the connection details to your Apache Cassandra cluster used to store the Reaper schema (reaper_db by default), in the `cassandra: ` section of the yaml file. 

A sample yaml file is available in the `resource` directory for each storage backend :  
* cassandra-reaper-memory.yaml
* cassandra-reaper-postgres.yaml
* cassandra-reaper-h2.yaml
* cassandra-reaper-cassandra.yaml


For configuring other aspects of the service, see the available configuration options in later section
of this readme document.



**Reaper Settings**

The Reaper service specific configuration values are:

* segmentCount:

  Defines the default amount of repair segments to create for newly registered Cassandra
  repair runs (token rings). When running a repair run by the Reaper, each segment is
  repaired separately by the Reaper process, until all the segments in a token ring
  are repaired. The count might be slightly off the defined value, as clusters residing
  in multiple data centers require additional small token ranges in addition to the expected.
  You can overwrite this value per repair run, when calling the Reaper.

* repairParallelism:

  Defines the default type of parallelism to use for repairs.
  Repair parallelism value must be one of: "sequential", "parallel", or "datacenter_aware".
  If you try to use "datacenter_aware" in clusters that don't support it yet (older than 2.0.12),
  Reaper will fall back into using "sequential" for those clusters.

* repairIntensity:

  Repair intensity is a value between 0.0 and 1.0, but not zero. Repair intensity defines
  the amount of time to sleep between triggering each repair segment while running a repair run.
  When intensity is one, it means that Reaper doesn't sleep at all before triggering next segment,
  and otherwise the sleep time is defined by how much time it took to repair the last segment
  divided by the intensity value. 0.5 means half of the time is spent sleeping, and half running.
  Intensity 0.75 means that 25% of the total time is used sleeping and 75% running.
  This value can also be overwritten per repair run when invoking repairs.

* incrementalRepair:

  Incremental repair is a boolean value (true | false). 
  Note that this is only supported with the PARALLEL repairParallelism setting.
  For more details in incremental repair, please refer to the following article
  http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/more-efficient-repairs

* repairRunThreadCount:

  The amount of threads to use for handling the Reaper tasks. Have this big enough not to cause
  blocking in cause some thread is waiting for I/O, like calling a Cassandra cluster through JMX.

* hangingRepairTimeoutMins:

  The amount of time in minutes to wait for a single repair to finish. If this timeout is reached,
  the repair segment in question will be cancelled, if possible, and then scheduled for later
  repair again within the same repair run process.

* scheduleDaysBetween:

  Defines the amount of days to wait between scheduling new repairs.
  The value configured here is the default for new repair schedules, but you can also
  define it separately for each new schedule. Using value 0 for continuous repairs
  is also supported.

* storageType:

  Whether to use database or memory based storage for storing the system state.
  Value can be either "memory", "database" or "cassandra".
  If you are using the recommended (persistent) storage type "database" or "cassandra", you need to define
  the database client parameters in a database/cassandra section in the configuration file. See the example
  settings in provided testing configuration in *src/test/resources/cassandra-reaper.yaml*.

* jmxPorts:

  Optional mapping of custom JMX ports to use for individual hosts. The used default JMX port
  value is 7199. [CCM](https://github.com/pcmanus/ccm) users will find IP and port number
  to add in `~/.ccm/<cluster>/*/node.conf` or by running `ccm <node> show`.

* jmxAuth:

  Optional setting for giving username and password credentials for the used JMX connections
  in case you are using password based JMX authentication with your Cassandra clusters.

    ```
    jmxAuth:
      username: cassandra
      password: cassandra
    ```

* enableCrossOrigin:

  Optional setting which you can set to be "true", if you wish to enable the CORS headers
  for running an external GUI application, like [this project](https://github.com/spodkowinski/cassandra-reaper-ui).

* autoScheduling:

  Optional setting to automatically setup repair schedules for all non-system keyspaces in a cluster.
  If enabled, adding a new cluster will automatically setup a schedule repair 
  for each keyspace. Cluster keyspaces are monitored based on a configurable frequency,
  so that adding or removing a keyspace will result in adding / removing the corresponding scheduled repairs.
   
* cassandra:
   
   Optional setting to provide cassandra store when ```storageType: cassandra```
   The sample here shows setup using plain authentication with ssl.
   ```
   cassandra:
     clusterName: "test"
     contactPoints: ["127.0.0.1"]
     keyspace: reaper_db
     authProvider:
       type: plainText
       username: cassandra
       password: cassandra
     ssl:
       type: jdk
   ```
   Refer to resource/cassandra-reaper-cassandra-ssl.yaml for cassandra with Auth 
   
   
Notice that in the *server* section of the configuration, if you want to bind the service
to all interfaces, use value "0.0.0.0", or just leave the *bindHost* line away completely.
Using "*" as bind value won't work.

Clusters with closed cross DC JMX ports
---------------------------------------

For security reasons, it is possible that Reaper will be able to access only a single DC nodes through JMX.
The *allowUnreachableNodes* parameter in cassandra-reaper.yaml must then be set to true in order for Reaper to control the repair process through the reachable nodes only.
Limitations of this setup are:  
 
* All keyspaces must be replicated on the reachable DC using NetworkTopologyStrategy
* Reaper won't be able to check the unreachable DC nodes for pending compactions or running repairs, which disables repair overload prevention

Leaving *allowUnreachableNodes* to false will prevent all repair sessions once a single node from the cluster is unreachable.

Building and Running Reaper
------------------------------------

To build Reaper without rebuilding the UI, run the following command : 

```mvn clean package```

To only regenerate the UI (requires npm and bower) : 

```mvn generate-sources -Pbuild-ui```

To rebuild both the UI and Reaper : 

```mvn clean package -Pbuild-ui```

To build the docker image :

```mvn clean package docker:build```

### Running Reaper

After modifying the `resource/cassandra-reaper.yaml` config file, Reaper can be started using the following command line :

```java -jar target/cassandra-reaper-X.X.X.jar server resource/cassandra-reaper.yaml```

Once started, the UI can be accessed through : http://127.0.0.1:8080/webui/

Reaper can also be accessed using the REST API exposed on port 8080, or using the command line tool `bin/spreaper`


Running a Dockerized Reaper Example
-----------------------------------

### Build Reaper Docker Image

First, build the Docker image and add it to your local image cache using the
`cassandra-reaper:latest` tag:

```mvn clean package docker:build```

### Start Docker Environment

First, start the Cassandra cluster:

```docker-compose up cassandra```

You can use the `nodetool` Docker Compose service to check on the Cassandra
node's status:

```docker-compose run nodetool status```

Once the Cassandra node is online and accepting CQL connections,
create the required `reaper_db` Cassandra keyspace to allow Reaper to save
its cluster and scheduling data.

By default, the `reaper_db` keyspace is created using a replication factor
of 1. To change this replication factor, provide the intended replication
factor as an optional argument:

```docker-compose run initialize-reaper_db [$REPLICATION_FACTOR]```

Wait a few moments for the `reaper_db` schema change to propagate,
then start Reaper:

```docker-compose up reaper```

### Access The Environment

Once started, the UI can be accessed through: http://127.0.0.1:8080/webui/

The helper `cqlsh` Docker Compose service has also been included:

```docker-compose run cqlsh```

### Destroying the Docker Environment

When terminating the infrastructure, use the following command to stop
all related Docker Compose services:

```docker-compose down```

To completely clean up all persistent data, delete the `./data/` directory:

```rm -rf ./data/```
